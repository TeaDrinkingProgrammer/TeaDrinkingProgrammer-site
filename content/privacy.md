My privacy policy is quite simple: I use [Goatcounter](https://www.goatcounter.com/) to get user-metrics. I wrote [a blogpost](@/blog/user_statistics.md) about how and why I use this software. In short: it is anonymous and pretty much just counts how many people watch a specific page in my blog. It also shows some anonymous data about the users, like the type of browser and their language.
